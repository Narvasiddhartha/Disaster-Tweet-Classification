**Description:**

This project focuses on classifying disaster-related tweets using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a classification model capable of accurately distinguishing between tweets related to disasters and those that are not. The project involves preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, developing machine learning models, and deploying the final model for real-time classification.

**Major Packages:**

To run this project, ensure you have the following major packages installed:

1. **numpy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
   
2. **pandas**: Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library.
   
3. **nltk**: NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
   
4. **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

5. **pickle**: Pickle is used for serializing and de-serializing Python objects.

6. **matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

7. **seaborn**: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

8. **wordcloud**: WordCloud is a Python package for generating word clouds from text data.

**Installation Instructions:**

To install the required packages, you can use pip, Python's package installer. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```

**Project Structure:**

- `Disaster_Tweets_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and evaluation.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission file.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing tweets and their corresponding labels.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset containing tweets to be classified.
- `README.md`: Project README file containing information about the project, major packages, installation instructions, and project structure.

**Running the Code:**

To run the code, open `Disaster_Tweets_Classification.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute each cell sequentially. Ensure that all required packages are installed before running the code.
